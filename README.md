# Simon's Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles, however other people are welcome to use them as they see fit.
The dotfiles are organized in such a way to be able to use gnu stow to install them, this means that each application has its own directory, and the root of each application directory should be treated as your home directory (~/).
